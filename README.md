Hello , viewer of this code, in this READ_ME ill describe you all about this.

This code is a simple code for Telegram Bot with Buttons , an some simple commands- /heh, /cmd, /hello, /poll... 
You could actually use this as a main for your bot and extend it as much as you can, code has not much commented scripts, but i think you'll understand everything!
